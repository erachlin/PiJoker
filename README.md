Pi Joker is a Balatro Joker Mod I made using Steamodded

Huge thanks to Grassy for the awesome art!

PiJoker is a fun joker based off of Ï€!


## How It Works
The PiJoker card is activated by your cards that are played but not scored.
Play cards from their hand in the sequence of Pi's digits (3.14159...).
For each correct digit played, Pi Joker's multiplier increases, enhancing the score for subsequent cards.
If an incorrect digit is played, the multiplier is reduced, but it never goes below 1.

## Scoring
Correct Digit: Each correct digit played increases the PiJoker's multiplier.
Incorrect Digit: Reduces the multiplier but does not reset the sequence.
## Strategy
Plan your hand to follow the sequence of Pi.
Keep track of the current digit in the sequence to maximize your score.
Use other cards strategically to maintain control of PiJoker and continue the sequence.
## Conclusion
PiJoker adds a fun and challenging twist to the game, requiring players to think ahead and strategize to maximize their score. Will you be able to follow Pi to victory?
